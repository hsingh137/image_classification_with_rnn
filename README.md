# Doing Image Classification with RNN 

## Description 
Using RNN to do Image Classificaton.


## How it Works? 
How does a RNN classify an Image?

RNN is a sequence based neural netwok that typically used for timeseries or NLP.

 - going to start a with an approach that goes 28 sequence length, with each vector containg the vertical column.
 - these weill be fed into the RNN.  
 
 
 


## Data
we will be just using the MINST dataset. 
which is 60K images which is 28 by 28 grid  with values ranging from 0-255
